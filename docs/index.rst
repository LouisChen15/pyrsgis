pyrsgis: A Python package to read, process and export GeoTIFFs.
===============================================================

pyrsgis enables the user to read, process and export GeoTIFFs. 
The module is built on the GDAL library, but is much more convenient 
when it comes to reading and exporting GeoTIFs. There are several 
other functions available in this package that ease raster pre-processing, 
some focused on machine learning applications.

This documentation was first created on 19 July 2021 and currently is
under development. Please check back later.

A more comprehensive usage guide can be found on the `GitHub`_ page of
the project.
