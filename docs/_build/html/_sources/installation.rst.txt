Installation
============

pyrsgis supports python 3.5 to 3.8 only. However, since there is no 
major reliability on the Python version, it should work on all Python 3 
versions. Please ensure that you are using a python 3 environment.

Installing using PyPi
---------------------------

pyrsgis is available on the `Python Package Index`_ repository.
It can be installed using pip from command line using the following command::

  pip install pyrsgis


If you want to install a specific version, you can check the `release history`_
on the PyPI page to find out your version and install it by explicitly 
specifying the version.::

	pip install pyrsgis==0.4.0

This can be useful since stable and latest versions are different.

Installing using Conda
------------------------------

pyrsgis is available on `Anaconda`_ too. It can be installed using the following
command::
	
	conda install -c pratyusht pyrsgis
	

Contributing to pyrsgis
------------------------------
pyrsgis is an open-source non-profit project and suggestions/ contributions are
most welcome. To contribute to the project, you can fork the `GitHub repo`_, clone 
the repository locally, make changes to the cloned version and submit a pull request.
