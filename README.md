*pyrsgis* enables the user to read, process and export GeoTIFFs. The module is built on the GDAL library but is much more convenient when it comes to reading and exporting GeoTIFs. There are several other functions available in this package that ease raster pre-processing. Please check the [documentation page](https://pyrsgis.readthedocs.io/) for a list of functions that pyrsgis offers along with the sample code.<br/>

Feedback and doubts from users are most welcome. Since this is an open-source volunatry project, I always look forward to contributors. You can write to me at [pratkrt@gmail.com](mailto:pratkrt@gmail.com).

pyrsgis is available on both, PyPI and Anaconda. Please check the [installation page](https://pyrsgis.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html) for details.
